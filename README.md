# ES6_Chrome_Dino

A proof-of-concept attempt at converting the ubiquitous Chrome Dino from using the old prototype object to the OO methods allowed by ES3.  This primarily means converting the main Runner function into a class, and all the previous prototype methods converted into static methods under the class.  This also avoids the awkwardness of Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (such as used in Edge's Let's Surf game) which can make debugging and education easier.
